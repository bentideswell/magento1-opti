- 1.6.0.4
- Improved the HTML minification so that most speed report scores for Minify HTML will go from 99 to 100.

- Added opti/source_blocks configuration node so that custom 'page/html_head' blocks can be placed around your site and compressed using this extension.

- The minified JS and CSS file names have been changed to a hash of file related data which includes the time the file was last edited. This means that each time you update a CSS or JS file, the cached version will automatically be recreated. With this feature, you no longer have to manually clear the cached files each time you make a change.
